Part 1 { Implement Basic Data Structures using Numpy, Pandas
1. Lists
2. Arrays
3. Identify their type using type()
4. Perform mathematical operations on these datasets created - multiplication, division,
powero
5. Combine text with Numpy fuction to generate a textual output - "Addition of Two:
array1 +array 2
6. Implement np.sin(), log(), log2(), np.exp())
Part 2 { Visualization of Data using matplotlib, pyplots Packages
1. Generate a Data set for Health Care using the following:
people = ['kiran', arun', 'vijay', 'varun']
age =[25, 30, 35, 40, 45]
height =[145, 151, 165, 173]
weight=[45, 55, 65, 75]
2. Using the generated dataset given above. Generate the following graphs and justify the
relationships among the vectors.
3. Scatter Plot
4. Bar Chart
5. Histogram
6. Provide Graph Title, labels for X, Y axis with proper justication and explaination of
the graph.

Part 3 { Access Data from Various Data Sources using builtin Func-
tion of Numpy, Pandas
1. Generate your own dataset using MS Excel and Notepad to prepare the dataset. Save
it in Google Drive and access it in Google Colab.
2. Upload the text le using tab seperated value(.tsv) and access the data from the le.
3. Upload the text le using comma seperated value(.csv) and access the data from le.
4. Access the excel le using .xlsx
5. Access the text from the URL
